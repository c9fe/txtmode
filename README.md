# txtmode
Upload any file, convert to txt, or convert txt back to the file, in the browser. No server. GitHub pages.

# Why?

Text is still a useful format. GMail will not allow attaching zip files. But what if I want to attach one anyway?

Convert to base 64 ( still blocked ) but then convert to words ? I think that will work. I just need 4096 english words. And code every base64 bigram with one word. And send it like that. GMail should not block. 

Make the web service encode and decode these type of files. Should be ok. 

# GMail

Actually GMail blocking sending zip files ( when there is no virus just HTML files inside ) is total BS. 

It's saying it's blocking it because of potential threats, but it doesn't even know how to test if there is a threat, and plenty of unthreatening things are blocked by this net. This is ridiculous and harmful and threatening to GMail users, people who depend on GMail, are basically "locked in" to it and now have the inconvenience forced upon them of this ridiculous measure. 

If you are going to block threats at least get good at detecting them like a virus scanner or something. 

And I think it's disingenuous / unscrupulous to degrade service on GMail to try to force people to use "GDrive" to send / as a gateway for files. F that seriously. That's just BS.
