# Why?

Text is still a useful format. GMail will not allow attaching zip files. But what if I want to attach one anyway?

Convert to base 64 ( still blocked ) but then convert to words ? I think that will work. I just need 4096 english words. And code every base64 bigram with one word. And send it like that. GMail should not block. 

Make the web service encode and decode these type of files. Should be ok.
