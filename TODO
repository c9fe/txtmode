- need to add a word at the start to see if we have even or odd number of letters 
    therefore if the first bigram is to be half or full
- also need to know if the icode we get from a word is < 64 and the bigram is full
we need to add an 'A' to the start.

- or we can solve both of these by just making no zero code
so that A = 1
